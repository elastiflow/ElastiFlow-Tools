This python script converts flowcoll.conf to flowcoll.yml. It looks in the current directory you are running the script from for flowcoll.conf and creates a flowcoll.yml. 
This script only works for newer versions that have the right environment variables defined in flowcoll.conf 6.x +.

To run:
python3 convert_config_to_yml.py
