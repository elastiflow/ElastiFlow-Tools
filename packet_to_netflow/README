NetFlow v5 Exporter for Windows



This guide provides a basic implementation of a NetFlow v5 exporter for Windows. The script captures packets using Npcap, aggregates them into flows based on the 5-tuple, and sends NetFlow v5 records to a specified collector.

1. Install Python (if not already installed)

Download and install the latest Python 3.x version from python.org.
During installation, check "Add Python to PATH".
If needed, manually add Python to PATH:


Example: 
C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\;

C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Scripts\;

Restart your Command Prompt (cmd).
Verify Python installation:
python --version
You should see a version response like: Python 3.x.x.






2. Install Npcap

Download and install Npcap from:
 Npcap Official Download
Choose the option "Install WinPcap API compatibility mode" during installation.






3. Install Required Python Packages

Open Command Prompt (cmd) as Administrator and run:



pip install pyinstaller scapy









4. Find Your Network Interface Name

To identify your network interface

at a command line type "ipconfig"



Look for your active network adapterâ€™s name (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or Ethernet 2).







5. Modify netflow_gen5.py Script

Open the provided netflow_gen5.py file and update the following lines:



COLLECTOR_IP = "10.101.2.148"  # Set your NetFlow collector IP

COLLECTOR_PORT = 2055  # Default NetFlow UDP port

INTERFACE = "Ethernet"  # Change this to match your Windows interface name



Replace "10.101.2.148" with the ElastiFlow IP.
Replace "Ethernet" with the correct interface name from the ipconfig output.






6. Run the NetFlow Exporter

Execute the script at the command line using:

python netflow_gen.py



This will start capturing packets, aggregating them into NetFlow v5 records, and sending them to your specified collector.
