ElastiFlow Support Pack Creator 1.3

This script assumes Elasticsearch and Kibana are both installed on the same server as ElasiFlow.

Purpose: 
To speed up ElastiFlow for ElasticSearch support ticket resolution. This script obtains copies of Elasticsearch, Kibana, and ElastiFlow configuration files and system configuration and bundles everything into an archive to send to ElastiFlow.

Usage:
sudo ./elastiflow_elasticsearch_support.pack.sh
